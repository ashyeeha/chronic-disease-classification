# Chronic Disease Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
The projects focus on applying supervised learning techniques for both **classification** and **regression** problems.

## Project Structure

- **Classification**
  - Predicts chronic diseases using patient health data
  - Includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation

- **Regression**
  - Predicts house prices using regression algorithms
  - Demonstrates data cleaning, feature scaling, model training, and performance evaluation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

Each project folder contains its own README file with detailed explanations.
