# Chronic Disease Classification

This project focuses on predicting chronic diseases using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Type
Classification

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project (`kidney_disease.csv`) is included in this repository.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open `chronic_disease.ipynb`
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially
3. Observe the model training and evaluation results

Learning Purpose
This is a beginner-level machine learning project created to understand the fundamentals of
classification, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.

Learning Outcomes
